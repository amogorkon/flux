    "## ATTPP (Actor-based Trait/Token Programming Paradigm)\n",
    "I've come up with this pattern for PL. The idea is to have a set() of flags - called traits that define the properties and methods of a class. Instead of defining \"classes\" of traits or subclassing explicitely, the traits are grouped into so-called \"stereotypes\", simple set()s of traits that can interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traits basically implement the flyweight and visitor pattern while simplifying the handling on the user side, overcoming all the problems of multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some issues here:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traits as enums?\n",
    "The first approach used a Trait(Enum) with name->Implementation, which seemed to work at first but being an enum, this mapping could never be changed, but worse: it never can be extended while all traits using the same implementation map to the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traits as classes?\n",
    "Classes in module-namespace act like enums (they are singletons), but unlike enums, their implementation can be changed on the fly and classes can be added.\n",
    "This may be a feasible solution, but it adds the temptation to have state in the Trait() which actually belongs to the Thing() and should be shared with other traits, adding unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traits as static methods?\n",
    "If we accept that traits should have no state by itself, we could take the functional route and implement them as externalized methods of Thing. This can be done by having a Trait class which just acts as a namespace for @staticmethods, taking Thing() as parameter that can be introspected. The Thing.bag is a very powerful datastructure that can be used to establish locks and loops across traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actors!\n",
    "Almost forgot the purpose of the exercise: to separate the implementation from the Thing to easily switch it on the fly, depending on the context. So, all we need to do is to go with the first approach - traits as enums - but then have an Actor/Visitor class that implements the details, simply checking the thing for traits and tokens. It's really simple and elegant even. As traits and tokens are enums, their namespaces are seperated, typos are caught instantly and the resulting code is clearly readable with a minimum of noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are things that should be stored with a thing but can't easily be coded as a trait or token (for instance the coordinates of a portal), it's best to have an external WeakKeyDictionary store the data associated with the thing (flyweight pattern) so that traits and tokens can be used as \"metadata\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## FSM!\n",
    "Implementing finite state machines with enums really is cool and simple, as shown elsewhere. To implement complex kinds of FSM you need some kinds of tokens - but wait! Traits are enums and they work in tandem with tokens! This smells like a delicious cake of pattern-goodness."

    "## pluggable adapter, delegator or trait with flyweight\n",
    "this is an exceptionally useful combination of patterns for several reasons:\n",
    "firstly, no subclassing is necessary. this means there are no collisions of methods and attributes, reducing complexity a lot. It also means Entities and delegators can easily be subclassed for other reaons as long as the method signatures are compatible (kwargs, not positional for cooperative super()!). \n",
    "use NotImplemented instead of NotImplementedError for quick check without exceptions. the delegation class should be just a set of related methods with no internal state. this should enable easy functional testing of the delegation with no side effects. last but not least, handling the delegation as a property allows quick and uncomplicated hotplugging of delegators with no change of call-semantics whatsoever. this means the calling side can't and shouldn't care about the current implementation (it could change at any time!), enforcing loose coupling in calling. this also helps in keeping the code at the calling side real simple since only the Entity with a property is called. last but not least, extra needed state associated with the delegator can easily be stored outside in a WeakKeyDict or WeakValueDict so that no unnecessary housekeeping, overcrowding of the Entity namespace or internal state inside the delegator is needed, enabling the flyweight pattern (very little internal state, no \\__dict\\__, and \\__slots\\__ instead)."

    "## SSCCE for trait-token paradigm programming \n",
    "(Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example)\n",
    "This is the simplest example I could come up with to illustrate the trait-oriented programming pattern I developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, an enum is declared as a contract between all parties involved. All parties promise to use *only* the enum as traits **nothing else**. \n",
    "2. The Thing class only has traits (as a set of enum) to define behaviour and tokens (as a counter of enum) for a minimum of state. If more state is needed, it can/should be externalized via properties operating on global dicts.\n",
    "3. Any behaviour is externalized into Actor classes or simple handler functions with no state. They are envoked from an accept function in the Thing class, which passes the instance to the Actor/handler. The Actor/handler introspects the traits and tokens of the thing and operates accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This clearly separates state from functionality: Thing represents state (traits, counter and interface to global dicts), Actor implements functionality without state.\n",
    "The first and obvious advantage of this pattern is that it is trivial to expand and recombine functionality on the fly without hardcoding classes and subclasses. Since traits are realized as sets of enums, handling of \"classes\" is simple, safe and fast. This extraordinary combination of qualities is hard to achieve otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another obvious advantage of this pattern is that it implements the foundation of finite state machines (FSM), making it trivial to realize any type of any complexity of state machine from here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linchpin: case handling\n",
    "The pattern stands or falls depending on how cases are handled in the Actor class, realizing the traits. If there are many cases (more than 2), it is advisable to use the dictionary-switch-pattern. Depending on how the traits actually should be handled, it's possible to use tuples of bool as keys to identify cases and test against traits once (that's one of the most efficient ways). This is recommended for traits that interact. If there are traits that are independent of each other, they can be handled in a for-loop over the dict of cases, this time with frozensets of traits to test against.\n",
    "Since traits are implemented as sets, many complex tests (for instance supersets) can be realized efficiently without making the code complicated."

    "Since we figured out how to dispatch on different sets of traits, let's see how easy it is to implement the stateful GUI of PL.\n",
    "Okay, it seems there's an even more elegant way than using dispatch here. If the states are implemented as classes - not enums - it's possible to simply use @staticmethod for the states and have all problems fixed at the same time: 1) The state definition is a well-named singleton with auto-completion 2) it's trivial to define enter() and exit() for each state and call them on every flux (simply override flux_to) 3) it's easy to \"dispatch\" methods per state - states don't need to be instanciated but can be decorated with @staticmethod so they can be called just like that - exactly the way the dispatch would work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an even more elegant solution since it takes care of dispatching state-dependent methods with no boilerplate at all. The state transition definition is clean and easy as it should be while it's still trivial to have state-dependent traits as flags and the state manager also has a bag to keep track of any additional info."
